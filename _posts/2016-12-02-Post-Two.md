What do you do when your sad?...  I see it as two ways... you can either deny the feelings and somehow live in a delusion pretending lifes "just groovy" when in fact it's not.  


Or you can accept the sadness... feel like shit for a day or two then try your best peace with it. Either feel "happy sad" or feel flatout "happy".  It seems to me that by trying to synthisize a... "nice" ver of your life, your lieing to yourself.
