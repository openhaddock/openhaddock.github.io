This readme contains the basic overview of what to expect and be warned about on this website.

Expect
======

+ No bullshit
+ No spillchick... haha (ironic)
+ My real thoughts.


Warning
=======

+ When I say "all" or "everytime" I mean 98%.  I understand theres always an exclusion, therefore when I literally mean 100% I'll say "everytime, 100%"
+ Emojicons are there fore a reason.  I use :) to reassure you of my best intentions.  Don't get pissed.  :)
And ;) exist to point to some subtle (or unsubtle) humour. ;)
+ I use alot of asterisks to indicate footnotes... when reading please read the F'ing footnotes! :)
+ I may use explicit language to enhance my sentences, or more accurately express my emotions. :)
+ I NEVER misspell anything!  I'm simply correcting this screwed up language ;)
==================================


I'm here to write, to express, to show, my ideas, my feelings, my shit.  This is my world, if you don't like it don't come.  If you have a... comment/critique... feel free to send it to me. But don't expect me to do it. :)
